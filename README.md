# TechnicalDrawingProject

Project created for technical drawing course (420-LCV-05) at Marianopolis College. 
Project was created using Autodesk's Fusion 360 by Ramy Attalla. Acheived a grade of 95%.

Abstract:

  Technical drawing is a discipline and part of any engineering process that requires design. Using 
many manual techniques, we can sketch and design various objects and parts that range in size 
and complexity. CAD programs such as Fusion 360 are programs that computerize the process 
and facilitate the sketching, design and testing of objects. This report describes the design of a 
webcam using Fusion 360 following ASME standards and primary metric units. Currently, 
webcams remain crucial for online conferencing, online courses, and streaming. The USB A 
connected webcam designed in this report is a camera with a sound-cancelling microphone and 
two-piece stand that allows it to be placed on top of any monitor, laptop, or tabletop. 

Keywords: ASME, CAD, USB, webcam, design, sketch
